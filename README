fling -- transfer data from stdin over network to destination quickly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

fling transfers data quickly over a trusted network. It does not
encrypt the data.

You need to run fling on both ends of the transfer. Run it first on
the receiver:

    fling 12756 > file.dat

And then on the sender:

    flint other.host.address 12756 < file.dat

Note that sender reads the data from its stdin, receiver writes it to
stdout.


To build
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get source code from <https://github.com/rjek/fling> and build it on
Linux by running the `make` command. Copy the `fling` binary to the
target host, or build a fresh copy there.
